# MiniHamowniav2

This is the main repository for the SRAD static fire station electronics module developed by PWr in Space Science Club of Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.

## ESP32 platform

Built in the Arduino framework (PlatformIO) with active use of FreeRTOS, on the ESP32 platform. Allows for:
```
    1. A fully remote static fire test of a solid/hybrid/liquid rocket motor with the help of built in ESP32 Bluetooth.
    2. Thrust and oxidizer weight measurements during the test.
    3. Temperature measurement
    4. DC motors/servo(optional) control for valves
```
